<p>In this unit, I developed an alphabet app designed for children using MIT App Inventor and other tools. I learned how to design, build, test, and review a mobile app by combining existing code and original assets. This helped me understand how apps are created and improved my skills in app development.<p/>

<P>A understand the characteristics and uses of mobile apps:<P/>
<P>I learned about mobile apps and how they are different from other types of software. I explored different kinds of apps, such as games, tools, and entertainment apps, and how people use them in daily life. I also found out how mobile devices, like smartphones and tablets, affect how apps are made â€” including things like screen size, battery life, and touch controls.</P>

<P>B design a mobile app:<P/>
<P>I designed my own mobile app by thinking about who would use it and what they needed. I created simple sketches and plans to show how the app would look and work. I also thought about how to make the app easy and fun to use, and made sure it would be accessible to as many people as possible.<p/>

<p>C - Develop and test the mobile app:<P/>
<P>I developed my app by combining ready-made code and assets like buttons, images, and sounds. I also wrote some original code to give my app unique features. I tested the app to find and fix problems and asked other people to try it out and give me feedback.<p/>

<P>D - review the finished mobile app:<P/>
<P>After finishing the app, I reviewed it and thought about what went well and what could be improved. I listened to feedback from users and identified ways to make the app better. I also learned how I could publish the app online so other people could download and use it.<P/>
